## Technical Architecture

### Data Processing Pipeline

```
YAML Tools Data ‚Üí Analysis Engine ‚Üí Archetype Scoring ‚Üí Recommendation Engine ‚Üí User Interface
```

1. **Tool Analysis**: Automatically analyzes tool descriptions to extract characteristics
2. **Archetype Scoring**: Calculates compatibility scores for each developer archetype
3. **Learning Integration**: Incorporates user feedback to improve scoring algorithms
4. **Recommendation Generation**: Produces ranked, contextualized tool recommendations

### Machine Learning Components

#### Characteristic Analysis
- **Learning Curve Detection**: Identifies tools as having gentle, moderate, or steep learning curves
- **Customization Level**: Determines minimal, moderate, or extensive customization options
- **Tag Extraction**: Automatically extracts relevant tags from tool descriptions

#### Scoring Algorithm
```javascript
finalScore = (baseArchetypeScore * archetypeAdjustment * categoryMultiplier) 
           + feedbackAdjustment 
           + characteristicBonus
```

#### Learning Weights
- **Category Preferences**: Learns user preferences for tool categories
- **Characteristic Preferences**: Adapts to user preferences for specific tool characteristics
- **Archetype Adjustment**: Fine-tunes archetype confidence based on feedback

### Compatibility Matrix

The system identifies tool combinations that work well together using:
- **Predefined Rules**: Known good combinations (e.g., VS Code + Git)
- **Category Synergy**: Tools from complementary categories
- **Community Patterns**: Common usage patterns in the developer community

## API Reference
